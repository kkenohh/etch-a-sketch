## Introduction

Once again, I've forgotten to write an introduction.

## Analysis

This one was a lot easier than I expected. I think once I learn more, I'll try to change it so that it's not on mouseover, but on click and drag. So it doesn't draw unless you hold down left click.

Honestly, pretty fun and cool. I feel like my code might be redundant, but I can't find anything right now.

I also like using RegExes. They're so helpful and I want to get better at understanding and using them.
